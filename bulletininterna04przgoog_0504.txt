Nervous trunks. All the 1611 longitudinal nerves and three
transversal nervous rings‚ described by Cohn in D. laevis 816 8180
found in the worm in question. In addition to them one sees here
still: 1) an inner thin nerve ring, lying on 1116 boundary of the pro-
glottides (fig. 19, n. n. t. in.). towards the inner transversal 1111186168,

glands, and start from the middle external nervous ring, near the

Reproductive organs. The most important difference be·-
tween D. laevis and D. sui-generis consists in the number of the
testes, vasa offerentia and vasa deferentia. Whilst in the former
species there 816 only three testes, in D. sui-generis their number
varies from 3 to 7. The common number is ὃ 10 6 (68. 12, 13, tes).
A more important detail is that from each testis proceed several
vasa 6116166118, 111 various numbers, 2 10 5 (fig. 14, v. ef.). Winding
many times and joining one another, they form 8 very much com-
plicated net of canale, which opens into the proximal ends of both
vasa deferentia (fig. 14, v. def). It is interesting 10 11016 11181 those
proglottides which do not possess the middle testis (fig. 14) 601118111
nevertheless a similar net (68. 20, 1. ef.)‚ a fact which can only
be explained by the supposition that the testis disappearcd⁷ leaving
however its vasa efferentia.

The author considers the cells surrounding the seminal vesicle
(fig. 14, 6. p.) as 818111111181, producing an albuminoide fluid, in
which the spermatozoons swim and which 6118 1116 vesiole, also the
second little vesicle near the circus-pouch and, in the older proglot—
tides, both vaginae and the vagina eommunis (fig. 17). The hooks
upon the cirrus (fig. 15) resemble those· in D. laevis according to
the description of Jacobi (and contra (joh n). In the structure of
