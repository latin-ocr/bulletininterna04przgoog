The authors studied the corelation of so called b-haemin of
Moerner and acethaemin, described by Nencki and Zaleski. The
latter authors ascribed to acethaemin the formula (334 ΗΜΘ4 Ν4 F eol
and consider Moerners haemin to be an ethylaether of acethaemin.
This conclusion has been opposed by W. Kfister who believes
,tl-haemin 10 be a haemin sui generis. According to the latest re-
searc-hes by Zaleski‚ „acethaemin“ is a misnomer‚ and the substance
known under this name must be considered as the first coloured
product, produced irem haemoglobin under the influence of hydro-
lytical agents. Under these conditions it was necessary to clear up,
if possible, the real corelation of the two substances named. We
propose to communicate in this preliminary note the results we
have obtained hitherto, and we hope to be able to return to the sub-
ject 011 a further occasion.

Based upon a series of experiments‚ of which only a few will
be named here, we arrived at the conclusion that the composition
of Moerners haemin depends in a considerable degree on the phy-
sical conditions‚ under which the experiments are carried out, and
that3 in most cases, this haemin contains only very little of etho-
xyl groups‚ although it is never quite free from them. In 011101
words² we find that firstly‚ the view advanced by Nencki and Za-
leski concerning Moerners haemin cannot be applied in general,
although we deem it quite possible that under certain conditions
one may obtain a product that will contain as much as 6·6⁰s0 ΟΟ2 H5
in form of etboxyl groups, and secondly that Kusters contention
cannot be upheld. In our opinion Moerners haemin is a mixture
of acethaemin with greater or smaller quantities of its ethers‚ a view
based upon the fact that it is possible 10 obtain acethaemin from
Moerners haemin.

Acethaemln. 1 L. of glacial acetic acid, saturated with sodium
chloride‚ was heated to 95⁰ and added to this 20001113 of blood (free
from fibroine); the mixture was heated up again to 950 and left
to cool and crystallize. We obtained well developed crystals corre-
sponding exactly to the description given by Nencki and Zaleski
The crystals were recrystallized according to Schalfiejew's method,
and gave on being analyzed the following results: O: 62 350s„
