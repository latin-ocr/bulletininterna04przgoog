moer-nere haemin. Ι”· preparation. l¹l2 litere of water were heated
to 95⁰, acidulated by adding 5001113 1010 0011111011 of Η2 800, and mi-
xed with 50001113 of blood. The precipitate was filtered off in a fil-
ter prese, mixed with 2500m³ of 0100110101111 pressed again. The pu-
rified precipitate was next mixed with 800cm³ of 01001101 10 11111011
801113 of conc. sulphuric acid were added, stired for an bour and
filtered. The filtrate heated to the boil, 4cm⁸ of 25010 hydrochloric
acid added, and left to crystallize. The crystals obtained were not
well developed, they possessed the shape of 11001110ος uncrystallized
matter was also present. The analysis gave: 6334, 6310, 6379010 C,
8·l9⁰s0, 85401οΝ 01111 1·72, 1·81010 OC„ Ηο.

Second preparation. The procedure differed from the foregoing
in as much, as the addition of hydrochloric acid took place in the
cold and the liquors left to crystallize at a temperature of 250.
In this manner nearly rectangular 1110100 were obtained which, on
being analyzed, gave 63·21⁰s0, 6828010 03 8·69⁰s0 N 870010 Ν,
106010 OG, H5, 1·13010 OC, Ηο.

Third preparation. The treatment with hydrochloric acid took
place this time at a still lower temperature namely at 140, and
the solution left 01 11110 temperature for 24 boui-s, The precipitate
obtained has been amorphous and could 1101 110 crystallized either
from 000110 00111 or 01001101.

The fourth preparation was obtained similarly to the second, but
the treatment with hydrochloric 00111 took place 011110 temperature
of the 11011 01111 kept at it for 1110 honre. The substance obtained
was amorphous and gave on being analyzed 64·76⁰s0 O, 7·54⁰s0 N,
3·61⁰s0 OC2 Ηο.

The fifth preparation, was obtained like the second, but the
treating with hydrochloric acid took 111000 01 50⁰. Well developed
crystals were this time obtained, which resembled those of the
second preparation, and did not appreciatly alter, even at the 11011,
by hydrochloric acid. The crystals were next recrystallized using
a method similar to that of Schalfejew, but with the difference, that
instead of quinino, dilute ammonia, and instead of chloroform water
had been used, (4 gr. haemin, 501113 0111111οηί0 01111 20001113 H2O).
The solution has been filtered quickly and poured into boiling
acetic acid, which had been previously saturated with sodium 01110-
