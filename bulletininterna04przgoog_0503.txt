of the body. Spiculum 935 μ in length. Its poucb covered with
little spines. The form of the bursa is shewn by figs. 8 and 9.

5. Trichosoma simile sp. n. (figs. 10, 11), from the intestine
of Turdus pilaris L. Female: 128 mm. long3 neck 58 mm. long.
Lateral hands about 23 μ broad, i. e. ¹s3 of the breadth of the
body3 ventral band 14 μ broad, i. e. ¹s⁶ of the same breadtb. Ge-
nital opening near the end of the oesophagus. Eggs 66- 68 μ long
and 30—32 μ broad, with a delicate superficial net. Male: Body
about 7 (P) mm. long3 the posterior part of the body (behind the
neck) 2·6 mm. long. Lateral bands 14 μ broad, i. e. ¹l4 of the
breadth of the body3 ventral band 7·5 μ broad, i. e. ΙΙ, of the same
breadtb. Spiculum 0·5 mm. in length. The form of the bursa is shown
by fig. 11.

6. Diploposthe sui-generis sp. n. (P) (fig. 12—20). One
specimen only of this tape-worm, found by the author in the intes-
tinum of a Fuligula leucophthalmos Bechs., could not be deter-
mined with certainty because the head with books and the older
proglottides with oncospheres were missing in it. The structure of
the internal organs however, especially of the reproductive male
organs, offers many details so different from those in D. laevis Dies.
(the anatomy of D. lata Fuhrm. is up to the present unknown) as
described by J acobi (6) and Cohn (2), that the worm in question
may be considered: either as an interesting atavistic specimen of D.
laevis (or. D. lata P), or (and this seems more probable) as a new species.

We cite here some more important details:

' Musculature. Besides the five systems of the muscle fibers
described by J acobi and Cohn in D. laevis, here still occur three
new ones: 1) a layer of the subepithelial longitudinal thin muscle
fibers (fig. 16, m. l. sep.) under the profound epithelial cells, 2) a layer
of few very thin diagonal fibers crossing one another (fig. 16, m.
d.), lying between the last mentioned muscles and the external lon-
gitudinal ones, 3) a thick ring of circular or transversal muscle
fibers (fig. 19, m. t. ex.) near the posterior margin of each proglottis.
In the arrangement of the other muscles also some differences
occur, as shown by fig. 16 and 19. It will suffice to mention that
the inner longitudinal muscle bundles extend in D. sui-generis more
sideward, than in D. laevis (Jacobi): there are more over 2 to

3 bundles outside the vasa excretoria belonging to the same layer
(fig. 19, m. l. in..)
