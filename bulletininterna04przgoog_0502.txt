The author describes in this paper a new species of Metorchis
Looss, two new ones of Trichosoma Rud. and a curicus species of
Diploposthe Jacobi3 he also gives a new description of Trichosoma
resectum Duj. and mentions an interesting case in the anatomy of
Bilharziella polonica M. Kow.

l. Metorchis tener sp. n. (fig 1.). Found in the liver of
Mergus merganser R. Very similar to M. xanthosomus (Crepl.) Braun
(1902), differing by a more delicate and slender body, by the po-
sition of the posterior sucker almost in the middle of its length,
and much (twice to three times) smaller testes and ovary.

2. In one (amongst 58) male specimen of Bilharziella po-
lonica M. Kow. (1895) from an Anas querquedula L. the author
encountered the two intestinal branches quite separated up to the
posterior end of the body, as shewn by fig. 2.

3. Trichosoma resectum Duj. (1843) (fig. 3, 4, 5, 6). —
Although the desriptions of this worm, given by Du jardin (3),
Eberth (4) and v. Linstow (8), are sufficient to recognize the
specicS, they contain however some incorrections. It may be men-
tioned here that the latera] bands in the female are 20 -24 μ
broad, i. e. about ¹s4 of the breadth of the body, the ventral band —-
10-12 μ broad, i. e. ¹s3 of the same breadth3 in male, the former
bands are 12—14 μ broad i. e. ¹l6 of the breadth of the body
and ventral band ·-·· 6-7 μ broad, i. e. ¹s'10—-1l1, of the same
breadth. {egge-605⁴ long by 28 μ broad, with little longitudinal ribs
upon the ends. Spiculum 126 mm. long. The form of the bursa can
be understood only by means of the adjoined drawing-s (fig. 3, 4).

4. Trichosoma parile sp. n. (fig. 7, 8, 9). Found in the intes-
tine of Bubo maximus Siebb. Female: length 20 mm.; length of neck
7·ss mm. Lateral and ventral bands equal, 20 μ broad, i. e. ¹s4 of
the breadth of the body. Genital opening about o·1 mm. distant
from the posterior end 01 the oesophagus. Eggs 64 μ long and 32 μ
broad, with a superficial net of very delicate, chiefly longitudi-
nal ribs. Male: Body 16·1 mm. long3 neck 7³5 mm. long. Lateral
and ventral bands are equal, 10 μ broad, i. e. ¹!ss of the breadth
